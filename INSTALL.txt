|  Installation Instructions                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|


Prerequisites
-------------
  
  ShelfLister should run on any Unix server that has:
    -- a webserver (e.g. Apache) configured to run CGI scripts
    -- an Oracle database *or* an Oracle client
    -- Perl 5.8 or later
    -- the Perl DBI and DBD::Oracle modules

  For Voyager ILS customers, your Voyager database server should
  meet all the above requirements.  If you have a split server
  arrangement, your Voyager application server (e.g. a WebVoyage
  server) *might* work, provided an Oracle client and the
  Perl DBD::Oracle module has been installed.  

  Note that the Voyager 7 Apache webserver, as setup for Tomcat 
  WebVoyage, probably isn't configured to run CGI scripts. 

  In these installation instructions, replace {xxxdb} in the path
  names with your database name.

  This installation should be done while logged into the server as
  the "voyager" user.  However there may be some Apache config tasks
  that require root access. 


Installation steps 
------------------

  Download shelflister-3.0.zip and FTP in binary mode to your 
  Unix server. 

  Unzip:

	unzip shelflister-3.0.zip

  The zip archive should contain the following files:

	./shelflister-3.0/INSTALL.txt
	./shelflister-3.0/LICENSE.txt
	./shelflister-3.0/ShelfLister.cgi
	./shelflister-3.0/ShelfLister.English
	./shelflister-3.0/ShelfLister.ini
	./shelflister-3.0/touch-icon-ipad-72.png
	./shelflister-3.0/misc/dope.sh
	./shelflister-3.0/misc/prereqs.pl
	./shelflister-3.0/misc/README.txt
	./shelflister-3.0/webadmin/index.html
	./shelflister-3.0/webadmin/README.txt
	./shelflister-3.0/webadmin/shelflisterfiles.cgi

  	The dope.sh and prereqs.pl scripts are for doing diagnostics
	and are not a part of the ShelfLister application.

        The files in the webadmin directory are for optionally 
        utilizing WebAdmin to download Marked Item files.

        Note that ShelfLister 3.0 *does* utilize JavaScript, CSS and 
        image files (mainly jQuery Mobile); however those files are
        remotely hosted.  For more information on these CDN-hosted 
        files, see http://jquerymobile.com/download/ and
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Delivery_Network 

  File ownerships and permissions

	If the files don't unzip with the correct ownerships 
	and permissions, please make them look like this: 

	-rwxr--r--   voyager  exlibris   ...	dope.sh
	-rwxr--r--   voyager  exlibris   ...	prereqs.pl
	-rwxr-xr-x   voyager  exlibris   ...	ShelfLister.cgi
	-rw-r--r--   voyager  exlibris   ...	ShelfLister.ini
	-rw-r--r--   voyager  exlibris   ...	ShelfLister.English
	-rwxr-xr-x   voyager  exlibris   ...    webadmin/shelflisterfiles.cgi
        

  Installation locations

        The ShelfLister.cgi script can be placed in whatever directory is
	appropriate for CGI scripts according to how *YOUR* webserver is 
	configured.  The suggestions below are just that -- suggestions. 
	
	For instance, if you are running Apache for the *classic* 
	WebVoyage all of the ShelfLister files could go here:

	/m1/voyager/{xxxdb}/webvoyage/cgi-bin/ShelfLister.cgi
	                                    ./ShelfLister.ini
	                                    ./ShelfLister.English

	If you are running Apache for *Tomcat* WebVoyage, then
        it does not come configured to run CGI scripts, at least
        not under the Tomcat filesystem.  You may have to do the
	Apache CGI configuration yourself (see instructions below).

        Under Tomcat, it is recommended that the main shelflister script
        go here:

	/m1/voyager/{xxxdb}/tomcat/vwebv/context/vwebv/htdocs/vwebv/ShelfLister.cgi

	...and the ShelfLister config files here:
	/m1/voyager/{xxxdb}/tomcat/vwebv/context/vwebv/shelflister/ShelfLister.ini
	/m1/voyager/{xxxdb}/tomcat/vwebv/context/vwebv/shelflister/ShelfLister.English

	These directories may have to be created.

        If you already have a ./vwebv/context/vwebv/newbooks directory, you
        can put the ShelfLister.ini and ShelfLister.English files there.

        If you put the ShelfLister.cgi script in a different location, you might
        have to edit the script to change where it looks for the config files. 

        Add the iPad icon image file, touch-icon-ipad-72.png to the same directory
        that the ShelfLister.cgi file is in, e.g.:
        .../vwebv/context/vwebv/htdocs/vwebv/touch-icon-ipad-72.png

	*RECHECK* file permissions and ownerships AFTER the
	files are copied/moved to their installation directories.


Testing and configuration steps
-------------------------------

  1) Configure Apache for CGI
	If your webserver (e.g. Apache) is not already configured 
	to run CGI scripts, do that first.
        See: http://rocky.uta.edu/doran/vwebv/addcgi.html
             for more detailed instructions

  2) Configure ShelfLister
	Read the configuration comments in the ShelfLister.ini script
	and edit the "REQUIRED CONFIGURATION" parameters.

  3) Test
	Point a browser to the ShelfLister script, e.g.:

	http://yourserver.univ.edu/vwebv/ShelfLister.cgi
          -- or --
	http://yourserver.univ.edu/cgi-bin/ShelfLister.cgi

	You should see the ShelfLister barcode entry form.  

	If you see the ShelfLister.cgi Perl code, then the
	Apache CGI configuration (step 1) was not successful.

        ShelfLister 3.0 is designed to provide informational
	error messages via the browser.  If you get an error
	message, it should indicate what the problem is.
 
  4) Optional configuration
	Go back and make any other desired configuration changes in 
	the ShelfLister.ini and/or ShelfLister.English files  

        If you want your staff to be able to download Marked Item
        files via WebAdmin, then read the README file in the webadmin
        directory of the ShelfLister distribution.

Free advice
-----------

	As you edit the ShelfLister.ini and/or the ShelfLister.English
	configuration files/scripts, make sure you make backup copies.  
	That way if some configuration change renders Shelf Lister 
	unexecutable and you can't figure out how to fix it, you can 
	always backtrack to a previous working copy.

Support
-------

	I am a Systems Librarian with a full time job quite apart from 
	creating, enhancing, documenting, distributing, and supporting 
	ShelfLister.  Please keep that in mind and thoroughly read
	these installation instructions and the program comments 
	before contacting me for help.  Considerable effort has gone
	into the documentation, and chances are good that the answer
	to your question is contained there.  

	This is not meant to discourage you from contacting me,
	particularly in regard to bugs or issues that may impact other 
	users of the software.  I am also very interested in hearing 
	how the installation instructions and other documentation can
	be made clearer or otherwise improved.


That's all folks!

	Good luck and thanks for choosing ShelfLister.  :-)
